# Chrome Extension Conversion

This repository contains a Tampermonkey script that has been converted into a Chrome extension.

## Loading the Extension
1. Open the Chrome Extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Choose **Load unpacked** and select the `extension` directory from this repository.

The extension will then run the original userscript as a content script on the supported websites.
